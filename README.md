# Sleigh

Sleigh is a Studiologic Sledge program organizer. It's similar to the Sledge
Sound Mapper application that Studiologic provides, but I've had problems
getting that one to actually talk to the Sledge.

Sleigh ONLY works on MacOS.

# Getting Sleigh

To get Sleigh, you'll need to download the source code from  and compile it.
To compile the code, run `make`. To run the tests, run `make test`.

# Running

```
$ ./sledge
```
